07-Oct-2025 __ -- __ -- __ I totally fell in love with making diagrams, flow charts, bar charts, and a bunch of other things, which at this point I'm turning to the Marshall. For now, I have made some basic things that I have in my mind and want to move forward with. I will probably change them along the path, but for now, I decided on these ones __ -- __ -- __

I want to create a Java app for a Halloween party game featuring cute cats, designed to be fun and chill in an 8-bit pixel art style. 
This will also be my semester project, and I want to include something new and innovative, but I’m still brainstorming ideas.
I plan to make it a PC game and set up a landing page online. Plus, I’ll create a poster for a competition where the winner will receive prizes and an invite to the party. 

I will need help mainly with the mini games, as I want it to be a small indie game. I’ll work on the visuals myself, but the focus should be on using Java for the development. 
It’s important that I stick to object-oriented programming principles, and this is a high-level engineering project. 

16-Oct-2025  __  -- __ -- __ I'm coming back from the project in munich and on bus I decided some parts of the project that I want to move forward with I will try to make the changes and to see what happens and to see whether I like it or not.  __ -- __ -- __
It’s going to be a spooky, fun game, kind of Halloween-themed with friendly vampires and stuff. The main character gets lost trying to find their way to a party and faces a bunch of challenges along the way. The setting is a place called Babuland, and they’ll meet different people and play mini-games to tackle each problem. I’m thinking about 6-8 mini-games, each with its own style, like cute puzzles. For some cool innovation, I want to incorporate modern physics and gameplay mechanics, so it'll involve some tricky Java development. The game will be single-player, but there should be a leaderboard showing just first names and scores. If someone’s score is too low, there’ll be a scene where they get kicked out, which adds a competitive edge. At the start, I’ll ask for their name and some questions. For controls, it’d be great to have keyboard support, and mouse controls would be a nice touch too. Ideally, I want the same code to work for Android devices or even on a webpage so everyone can join in. I’m planning to use JavaFX for graphics, but I’m open to other options if needed. The audio will be a mix of copyright-free tunes and some snippets from characters. Overall, the idea is that players get lost, play mini-games to earn points, and those points will have some challenges involved because there won’t be a clear winner. I also want to switch between 2D and 3D visuals during the game, alternating between side and top-down views, both in third-person perspective.
