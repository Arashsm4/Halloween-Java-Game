I want to create a Java app for a Halloween party game featuring cute cats, designed to be fun and chill in an 8-bit pixel art style. 
This will also be my semester project, and I want to include something new and innovative, but I’m still brainstorming ideas.
I plan to make it a PC game and set up a landing page online. Plus, I’ll create a poster for a competition where the winner will receive prizes and an invite to the party. 

I will need help mainly with the mini games, as I want it to be a small indie game. I’ll work on the visuals myself, but the focus should be on using Java for the development. 
It’s important that I stick to object-oriented programming principles, and this is a high-level engineering project. 

All of the process and the resources have been recorded and included in this Git Repository.
